# Optimizing-Traffic-Signal-Control-with-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Road-Traffic-Management-with-DQN-

🚗 This repository contains an implementation of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent for optimizing traffic signal control in urban environments. This project explores the utilization of Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques, specifically the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm, to optimize Traffic Signal Control (TSC) in the domain of Road Traffic Management (RTM). By leveraging RL's ability to adapt to varying traffic conditions and the power of DQN in approximating optimal action-value functions, we aim to alleviate traffic congestion and improve traffic flow efficiency.

## 🌟 Overview

Traditional traffic signal control methods, such as fixed-time or actuated control, often struggle to adapt to dynamic traffic conditions, leading to inefficient traffic management and congestion. This project proposes a novel approach by leveraging the power of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to optimize traffic signal control in real-time. 🔄

The DQN agent is trained using real-world traffic simulation data generated by the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) simulator. The agent learns to make optimal decisions regarding traffic light phase configurations based on the current traffic conditions (number of vehicles in each lane) at intersections. 🚦
